# tfcoreml
TensorFlow (TF) to CoreML Converter

Dependencies
-------------

- tensorflow >= 1.5.0
- coremltools >= 0.8
- numpy >= 1.6.2
- protobuf >= 3.1.0
- six >= 1.10.0

## Installation

### Install From Source

To get the latest version of the converter, clone this repo and install from source. That is, 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml.git
cd tf-coreml 
```

To install as a package with `pip`, either run (at the root directory):

```shell
pip install -e .
```

or run:

```shell
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

This will generate a pip installable wheel inside the `dist` directory.

### Install From PyPI
To install the Pypi package:

```shell
pip install -U tfcoreml
```

## Usage

See iPython notebooks in the directory `examples/` for examples of
how to use the converter.

The following arguments are required by the CoreML converter:
- path to the frozen .pb graph file to be converted
- path where the .mlmodel should be written
- a list of output tensor names present in the TF graph
- a dictionary of input names and their shapes (as list of integers). 
  This is only required if input tensors' shapes are not fully defined in the frozen .pb file 
	(e.g. they contain `None` or `?`)

Note that the frozen .pb file can be obtained from the checkpoint and graph def files
by using the `tensorflow.python.tools.freeze_graph` utility. 
For details of freezing TF graphs, please refer to the TensorFlow documentation and the notebooks in directory `examples/` in this repo.
There are scripts in the `utils/` directory for visualizing and writing out a text summary of a given frozen TF graph. This could be useful in determining the input/output names and shapes.
Another useful tool for visualizing frozen TF graphs is [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/Netron).   

There are additional arguments that the converter can take. For details, refer to the full function definition [here](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/4873258a145664106154922ad8ee09a0a3729ee0/tfcoreml/_tf_coreml_converter.py#L395). 

**For example:**

When input shapes are fully determined in the frozen .pb file:
```python
import tfcoreml as tf_converter
tf_converter.convert(tf_model_path = 'my_model.pb',
                     mlmodel_path = 'my_model.mlmodel',
                     output_feature_names = ['softmax:0'])					
```

When input shapes are not fully specified in the frozen .pb file:
```python
import tfcoreml as tf_converter
tf_converter.convert(tf_model_path = 'my_model.pb',
                     mlmodel_path = 'my_model.mlmodel',
                     output_feature_names = ['softmax:0'],
                     input_name_shape_dict = {'input:0' : [1, 227, 227, 3]})
```


Following topics are discussed in the jupyter notebooks under the `examples/` folder:

**inception_v3.ipynb**: How to strip the "DecodeJpeg" op from the TF graph to prepare it for CoreML conversion.

**linear_mnist_example.ipynb**: How to get a frozen graph from the checkpoint and graph description files generated by training in TF. 

**ssd_example.ipynb**: How to extract a portion of the TF graph that can be converted, from the overall graph that may have unsupported ops.

**style_transfer_example.ipynb**: How to edit a CoreML model to get an image output type (by default the outputs are MultiArrays).

**custom_layer_examples.ipynb**: A few examples to demonstrate the process of adding custom CoreML layers for unsupported TF ops.

Note that certain parameterizations of these ops may not be fully supported. For ops marked with an asterisk, only very specific usage patterns are supported. In addition, there are several other ops (not listed above) that are skipped by the converter as they generally have no effect during inference. Kindly refer to the files `tfcoreml/_ops_to_layers.py` and `tfcoreml/_layers.py` for full details. 
For unsupported ops or configurations, the [custom layer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/core_ml_api/creating_a_custom_layer) feature of CoreML can be used. For details, refer to the `examples/custom_layer_examples.ipynb` notebook. 


Scripts for converting several of the following pretrained models can be found at `tests/test_pretrained_models.py`. 
Other models with similar structures and supported ops can be converted.

*Converting these models requires extra steps to extract subgraphs from the TF frozen graphs. See `examples/` for details. <br>
+There are known issues running image stylization network on GPU. (See Issue #26)


### Limitations

`tfcoreml` converter has the following constraints: 

- TF graph must be cycle free (cycles are generally created due to control flow ops like `if`, `while`, `map`, etc.)
- Must have `NHWC` ordering (Batch size, Height, Width, Channels) for image feature map tensors
- Must have tensors with rank less than or equal to 4 (`len(tensor.shape) <= 4`)
- The converter produces CoreML model with float values. A quantized TF graph (such as the style transfer network linked above) gets converted to a float CoreML model

## Running Unit Tests

In order to run unit tests, you need pytest.

```shell
pip install pytest
```

To add a new unit test, add it to the `tests/` folder. Make sure you
name the file with a 'test' as the prefix.
To run all unit tests, navigate to the `tests/` folder and run

```shell
pytest
```
